FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - HR PORTAL

TIME OFF AND LEAVE POLICIES

Q: How much PTO do I get per year?
A: Full-time employees receive 15 days of paid time off in their first year, increasing to 20 days after two years of service, and 25 days after five years. PTO accrues monthly based on your tenure level. Part-time employees receive prorated PTO based on their scheduled hours.

Q: What is the process for requesting time off?
A: Log into the HR portal and navigate to the Time Off section. Click "Request Time Off" and select your dates. Your manager will be notified automatically and typically responds within 48 hours. We recommend submitting requests at least two weeks in advance for better approval odds, though emergency requests are handled case-by-case.

Q: Can I carry over unused PTO to the next year?
A: You can carry over up to 5 days of unused PTO to the following calendar year. Any PTO beyond 5 days will be forfeited, so we encourage employees to use their earned time off. Carried-over days must be used by March 31st of the following year.

Q: What is the sick leave policy?
A: All employees receive 10 sick days per year, separate from PTO. Sick leave is meant for personal illness, medical appointments, or caring for immediate family members who are ill. Unused sick days do not roll over and cannot be cashed out.

Q: Do we have parental leave?
A: Yes, we offer 12 weeks of paid parental leave for primary caregivers and 6 weeks for secondary caregivers. This applies to birth, adoption, or foster placement. Leave must be taken within the first year of the child's arrival. Additional unpaid leave may be available under FMLA.

BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION

Q: When do health insurance benefits start?
A: Health insurance coverage begins on the first day of the month following your start date. If you start on the 1st, coverage begins immediately. You have 30 days from your hire date to enroll. Missing this window means you'll need to wait until the next open enrollment period unless you have a qualifying life event.

Q: What health insurance plans are available?
A: We offer three medical plan options through BlueCross: a high-deductible plan with HSA, a PPO plan, and an HMO plan. All plans include prescription drug coverage, dental, and vision. The company covers 80% of the employee premium and 60% for dependents. Plan details and costs are available in the Benefits Guide on the portal.

Q: How does the 401k matching work?
A: The company matches 100% of your contributions up to 4% of your salary. For example, if you earn $50,000 and contribute 4% ($2,000), we'll contribute an additional $2,000. Matching funds vest over four years at 25% per year. You're eligible to enroll in the 401k plan immediately upon hire.

Q: What other benefits do we get?
A: Beyond health insurance and 401k, we provide life insurance at 2x your annual salary, short-term and long-term disability coverage, an employee assistance program for mental health support, a wellness stipend of $500 per year for gym memberships or fitness equipment, and commuter benefits for parking or public transit.

Q: How do performance bonuses work?
A: Eligible employees can earn annual performance bonuses ranging from 0% to 20% of base salary, depending on individual performance ratings and company goal achievement. Bonuses are typically paid in March following the performance year. You must be employed at the time of payout to receive the bonus.

Q: Can I use my personal email for work communications?

Click your manager's name, select "Request Meeting," and choose available time slots. For urgent matters, you can also send a direct message through the internal communication tool.
